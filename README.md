Message-Grid
============

Grid built with multiple javascript libraries demonstrating loose coupling between models and using repositories to keep data access clean.

####KnocoutJS
Knockout is a great library with rich data binding support, simple to get started with and fantastic project documentation.

####Amplify
I started using this library and currently only use it for messaging, again very easy to get started with.

####jQuery
Mostly being used for ajax.

####Nancy FX
Great open source service framework for developing restful apis, good community and easy to get started with.
