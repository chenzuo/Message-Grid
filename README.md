###Description
Fun demo user management app showing off some cool features of popular JavaScript libraries and how you could use them to build a modular app with well organized code. I decided to build this because I frequently see demos using a single technology but don't often find any combing several. 

To login to the application use:<br>
**Username:** admin<br>
**Password:** admin<br>

Once you’ve logged in you can begin creating users, try creating a user then launching the app in a new tab and login, once you’ve got two sessions running you can add / delete users and watch how clients are kept in sync with using messages from SignalR.

###Javascript libraries being used:
- Knockout - used for data binding
- Amplify - used for messaging
- JQuery - use for dom manipulation and ajax
- Signal R Client - used for persistent connection
- Toastr - used for 'toast' messages

###.Net libraries being used:
- Nancy FX - used for REST web services
- Newtonsoft JSON - used to serialize objects
- SignalR Server - used for server side persistent connection
